In this repo, I'll show you how to use MLflow to:

- track your machine learning experiments based on:

  - metrics
  - hyper-parameters
  - source scripts executing the run
  - code version
  - notes & comments

- compare different runs between each other
- set up a tracking server locally and on AWS
- deploy the your best model using MLflow Models
